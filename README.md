## How to install locally

#### Install Redis on Mac

Source: [http://jasdeep.ca/2012/05/installing-redis-on-mac-os-x/](http://)

This chapter explains how you can install Redis on your Mac OS X system. The instructions will stay pretty much same for any Linux/Unix based system.

Grab the latest copy of Redis from this link [http://redis.io/download](http://). At the time of this writing the latest stable release is 2.8.5. Follow the instructions below now.

Download Redis. I downloaded redis to my Downloads folder on Mac.
First execute the `make test` command to make sure Redis can complete a clean install on your computer.
If no problems were found, continue by executing `make` on your terminal

``` $ cd ~/Downloads/redis-2.8.5 ```

```	$ make test ```

``` $ make ```

Next, move these 2 directories into your /usr/bin directory. Youâ€™ll need to do this as the sudo user.

```$ sudo mv src/redis-server /usr/bin```

```$ sudo mv src/redis-cli /usr/bin```

Now, make a hidden redis directory in your home folder and add a config file called redis.conf into this folder. You can consult the Redis Documentation on what options/parameters you can configure using this conf file.

```$ mkdir ~/.redis```

```$ touch ~/.redis/redis.conf```

Start up the redis server using:

```$ redis-server```

#### Clone the repo

Clone the project from: [git@github.com:dmissoh/mycoachRecommendationRaccoon.git](http://)

#### Navigate to the folder

```$ cd raccoon-recommendation```

#### Install ALL dependencies

```$ npm install```

#### Racoon configuration
Make sure that the configuration file **raccoon-recommendation/node_modules/raccoon/lib/config.js** has the following parameters set:

**className: 'recipies'** (used as a prefix for the Redis database)

**localSetup: true** (important to make Raccoon take the right port number)

#### Boot up servers in separate terminal windows

```$ redis-server```

```$ node node-server.js```

#### Import recipies
* Go to [http://localhost:3000/importRecipies](http://)
